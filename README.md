 Servers 1 - 5 are to be run on lab computers in the C lab.

 Clients select their servers by number (1 - 5). Then clients register a username on the network. Servers either confirm if the username is good or is already taken. 
 To send messages, clients type a ten character username into the "address to:" feild followed by the message they wish to send. 
 Clients can get messages by simply not typing anything in the "address to:" and "Message:" feilds.
 To disconnect, clients will type "disconnect" into both feilds. Clients may re-enter the network from any other terminal machine and re-register their username. The client should receive any messages from when she was offline.
